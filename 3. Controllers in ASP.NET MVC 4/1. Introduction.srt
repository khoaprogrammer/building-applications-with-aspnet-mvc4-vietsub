Xin chào, tôi là Scott Allen và trong chương này chúng ta sẽ dành thời gian

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
to understand how controllers work in the mvc framework.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Specifically we're going to look at the routing rules which deliver in the incoming requests

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
for from the web to our controllers and then look at controller actions.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You might remember from the introduction

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
that the controller actions are the public methods on our controllers.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
They have the ability to respond to an incoming http request from the web.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We'll also be taking a look at action filters which can introduce pre and post processing

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
to an action and then see how we can input data to an action with action parameters

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and output different types of results from an action using different action results.
